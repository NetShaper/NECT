NECT Emulator for Epoch:Human

Goal of this project:
To create a series of common classes, objects, functions to allow the creation of a NECT Terminal Emulator.

My idea is to create common libraries for things such as:
IRC client for the Epoch chat room,
RSS Parsing dedicated to the sub's posts, etc.
Emulate the actions (like firing weapons) that a user in the world would use. 
More as time goes on and the world expands. 

Why would we want to do this?
1) It would give everyone a way to feel "Inside" the world and still interact with it. 
2) It would be awesome!
3) It could be customizable enough to allow each person to tailor the "shell end" of the emulator to their desires (per the original idea for the technology).
